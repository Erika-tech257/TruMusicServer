Try to implement multithreading:
Multi-threading is similar to multitasking, but enables the processing of executing multiple threads simultaneously,
rather than multiple processes. The CompletableFuture, was introduced in Java 8, provides an easy way to write
asynchronous, non-blocking and multi-threaded code. The CompletableFuture implements Future interface, it can combine
multiple asynchronous computations, handle possible errors and offers much more capabilities.
